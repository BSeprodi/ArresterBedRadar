# IYPT 2023 - Arrester Bed

*Seprődi Barnabás - Team Hungary*

This is a measurement sofware written to measure indents made by a ball in a sand bed. This tool was developed for an IYPT ([iypt.org](https://www.iypt.org/problems/problems-for-the-36th-iypt-2023/)) problem 
called _Arrester Bed_. 

For a basic documentation of the program read [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md). To understand what the basic concept behind this tool is play around with a [demo](explanation.ggb) made in GeoGebra.
